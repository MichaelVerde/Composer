-- Xanadu  Meeting
-Coupling gates, nearest neighboour. 
-Conditional gates based off of the bottom line.
-Saving layout, re-opening system, with some default layouts. 
-Hide the rest of the bit line, after a measurement
-Re ordering entire bits oby dragging the kets on the left.

-Coupling gates, beam splitters, and other gates, should have modal popup for lgate settings


Single Mode Gates
S - Gate
-squeezing factor, complex
a -> -inf to inf
b -> -inf to inf

D - Gate 
displacement, complex
a -> -inf to inf
b -> -inf to inf

Phase - Gate 
-Phase 0 to 2pi

F - Gate-No params

X,Z,P -Gates
-1 real parameter

C Phase - Accross 2 Neares Neigbours

Beam Splitter 2-Mode Gate 
-Transmittivity 0 to 1 
-Phase 0 to 2pi

S 2-bit, same as B plus 2 s's 
-squeezing factor, complex
a -> -inf to inf
b -> -inf to inf

Measurements
-Quadratures X or P
-Average Photon Number 
-Int Measurement, set the number. 

-Subroutines, V2
